                <h2 id="Overview" class="heading">DR APJ ABHUL KALAM</h2>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist
                    who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,
                    Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a
                    scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation<br>
                    (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                    space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile
                    Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He
                    also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear
                    tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                    Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
                    "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service
                    after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
                    India's highest civilian honour.

                    While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                    from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level
                    dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried
                    with full state honours.

                <h2 id="Carrier" class="heading">CARRIER AS A SCIENTIST</h2>
                <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                    Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                    Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                    unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working
                    under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite
                    Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in
                    July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in
                    1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more
                    engineers.

                    Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley
                    Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and
                    Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar
                    Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.

                    Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
                    representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam
                    also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic
                    missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union
                    Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her
                    discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union
                    Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects. His research and
                    educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the
                    government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S
                    Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion
                    by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver
                    of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in
                    getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided
                    Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a
                    major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range
                    ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have
                    been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.

                    Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence
                    Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests
                    were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role.
                    Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing
                    phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear
                    scientist. However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had
                    been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram
                    dismissed the claims. In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost
                    coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent". In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for
                    health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".

                <h2 id="Award" class="heading">AWARDS AND HONOURS</h2>
                <p>Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities. The Government of India honoured him with
                    the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his
                    role as a scientific advisor to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian
                    honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of
                    defence technology in India. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from the National
                    Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".
                    In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the Greatest Indian.

                    Following his death, Kalam received numerous tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced
                    that his birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth Renaissance Day;" the
                    state government further instituted the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram
                    gold medal, a certificate and ₹500,000 (US$7,000). The award will be awarded annually on
                    Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to residents of the state with achievements in promoting
                    scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of students. On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in
                    2015 the CBSE set topics on his name in the CBSE expression series. Prime Minister Narendra Modi
                    ceremonially released postage stamps commemorating Kalam at DRDO Bhawan in New Delhi on 15 October
                    2015, the 84th anniversary of Kalam's birth. Researchers at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
                    (JPL) had discovered a new bacterium on the filters of the International Space Station (ISS) and
                    named it Solibacillus kalamii to honour the late president Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Several
                    educational and scientific institutions and other locations were renamed or named in honour of Kalam
                    following his death.
